\description{
These are based on a subset of forecasts of daily incident hospital
admissions for COVID-19 that were submitted to the US COVID-19 Forecast hub,
which have been lightly modified for expository purposes. To obtain point
forecasts, we extracted quantile forecasts at probability level 0.5.
